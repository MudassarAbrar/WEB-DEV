## 🔥 Why I Made This

> "The best way to learn is by building."

This repo is my digital playground — a place to practice, fail, succeed, and most importantly, **grow**. I’ll be documenting everything I learn, with code snippets, comments, and project folders, so future-me and others can look back and learn too.
